\section*{Abstract}
Computer systems have opened their place among the people of the society during the time they have entered our society.
The society has also felt the need for these systems in order to be able to do things faster with these systems.
Computer systems also require more advanced software.
Therefore, it is up to us to meet these needs by building the necessary software.
The student service system can also be one of these softwares to be able to meet some of these needs.
On the other hand, to produce these softwares, it is necessary to know the programming language, and NodeJS is one of these languages, which by learning the necessary skills in this The language can easily produce the software needed.
The student service system is for defining the project (employer) and carrying out the project (freelancer), which has features such as project insertion, student admission, search among students and search among projects, and editing and correcting information, and so on.
In the past, it was customary to work outside the home to earn a living, and working at home was not privately defined.
But recently, in the last few years, with the dramatic increase of the Internet space and in the nature of Internet businesses, family businesses such as freelancing have been introduced.
Freelance jobs do not need to be introduced in person, and those who have enough skills in their field will undoubtedly be able to succeed in this field and earn a good income.
